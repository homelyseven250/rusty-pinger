# rusty-pinger

Most of the files in this repo are just junk. The code is really messy and has old stuff so basically ignore everything but the structure.sql and src folder. It takes in the JSON output of masscan, but because of the way it parses it I think anything should work really. 

# You **will** need to decrease the thread count though.
Build links should be fixed now.
